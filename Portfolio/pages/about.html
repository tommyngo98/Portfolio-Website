                    <h1>Hello there! Welcome to my website!</h1>
                    <p id="aboutMe">My name is Tommy Ngo, I am 20 years old and I do live in the beautiful Berlin. I'm studying International Media and Computing at the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin. I'm currently about to successfully complete my fourth term and since we are supposed to get some work experience, too, I am now looking for an internship in a foreign country. 
                    </p>
                    <p id="projectInfo">
                    On this page you can find some information about the small projects I've been working on so far. Since I just started studying about two years ago, there is not much to look at here yet, but I hope to collect some more awesome stuff on this page as soon as possible! Feel free to have a look at my portfolio. If you have further questions, please let me know.</p>
